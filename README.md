# MONKE-Protocol

## Requirements:
Reliable Data Transfer in Application Layer using Selective Repeat Automatic Repeat ReQuest protocol using UDP sockets.

## Why MONKE Protocol?
We name this protocol the MONKE protocol as a reference to one of the currently trending jokes circulating on social media, which features the tagline “REJECT HUMANITY, RETURN TO MONKE”. The name is meant to be slightly ironic, as the circulation of such jokes (which suggest returning to a more primitive lifestyle) is heavily dependent on the underlying networks (and thus modern technology) that connect these users.

The name is also a homage to RFC 2795 - The Infinite Monkey Protocol Suite (IMPS) - which was published as part of the Internet Engineering Task Force’s yearly tradition of creating an RFC as a joke every April Fools’ Day.
